              Bringing four years of comprehensive experience in full-stack
              development to the table, I have honed my skills across a diverse
              range of programming languages and frameworks. My expertise spans

              deploy scalable software solutions efficiently. My journey in the
              tech industry has been marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge
              and a deep commitment to developing applications that not only
              meet but exceed user expectations.

                I work with a team of three developers to enhance and refine an industry-leading software platform that connects over 3,000 digital advertising screens in New Zealand and 4,000 in Australia, making Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH) advertising more accessible for small and medium-sized businesses.
                <br />
                One of my key contributions has been designing, building, and implementing a preview system that allows users to see how their ad will appear on a billboard before purchasing the space. This feature improves user confidence and streamlines the ad booking process. In addition to adding new features, I also focus on refactoring existing systems to improve performance, maintainability, and scalability.

                I optimized database queries, reducing load times by 90%, making the system significantly faster and more efficient. I worked as part of a team of five full-stack developers to modernize a legacy parking permit system, replacing thousands of paper permits with a digital solution.
                <br />
                This role involved working with international teams across the UK, Australia, the US, and New Zealand. I also mentored junior developers, guiding them through caching strategies, GraphQL, Next.js, and Node.js to help them get up to speed. Additionally, I stepped into an interim team lead position, conducting regular reviews and mentoring a small team. This experience helped me develop my leadership skills as I prepare for a senior role.
