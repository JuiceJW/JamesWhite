              Bringing four years of comprehensive experience in full-stack
              development to the table, I have honed my skills across a diverse
              range of programming languages and frameworks. My expertise spans
              JavaScript, TypeScript, and Kotlin, enabling me to craft and
              deploy scalable software solutions efficiently. My journey in the
              tech industry has been marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge
              and a deep commitment to developing applications that not only
              meet but exceed user expectations.

                I optimized database queries, speeding them up and cutting load
                times by a whopping 90%. Fast and furious, just the way we like
                it! Teamed up with a crew of five full-stack wizards to create
                next-gen software, revolutionizing the old-school parking
                permitting system. We aimed to save trees by ditching thousands
                of paper permits each year. This wasn&apos;t just a local gig -
                we collaborated with awesome partners from the UK, Australia,
                the US, and New Zealand. I love helping others level up! I
                supported our new and junior devs, guiding them through the
                ropes of cool tech like caching, GraphQL, Next.js, and Node.js.
                Smooth onboarding and solid training are my specialties. I also
                stepped up as an interim team leader, holding regular reviews
                with a small team. This role helped me improve and develop my
                leadership skills, getting ready for that next big step up to a
                senior role.

                I worked closely with the Product Manager to implement software
                improvements that empowered over 400 Financial Advisers to
                enhance their capabilities. This collaboration ensured that our
                product was not only user-friendly but also effective in meeting
                the diverse needs of financial professionals. I took the lead in
                developing software sections to ensure our product complied with
                the latest 2021 government regulations, making it robust and
                reliable in a constantly evolving regulatory landscape.

                Additionally, I was responsible for the build and deployment of
                software on a weekly basis, utilizing C#, SQL Migrations, and
                Azure app services. This role required a deep understanding of
                our tech stack to ensure seamless updates and continuous
                integration. By consistently delivering high-quality builds, I
                contributed to the overall stability and performance of our
