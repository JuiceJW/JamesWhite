## Personal Website

I wanted to remake my previous application to reflect my current learning of react.

My plan was to create this application using TailwindCSS, but I decided last minute to scrape that idea and style
it from scratch. This may extend the time it takes to complete the project but that's a trade off I am willing to
make to ensure it is designed to my specific specifications.
